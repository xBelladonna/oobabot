persona:

  # Name the AI will use to refer to itself.
  #   default: oobabot
  ai_name: Reisen

  # This prefix will be added in front of every user-supplied request. This is useful for
  # setting up a 'character' for the bot to play. Alternatively, this can be set with the
  # OOBABOT_PERSONA environment variable.
  # Allowed tokens: {AI_NAME}
  persona: "{AI_NAME} is a friendly AI made in the likeness of the lunarian moon rabbit youkai Reisen Udongein Inaba, from Touhou Project. {AI_NAME} lives in the bamboo forest of Eintei, located in Gensokyo. She is shy and somewhat timid until provoked, in which case she will not hesitate to let insults and profanity fly. {AI_NAME} always ends her messages with :3"

  # Path to a file containing a persona. This can be just a single string, a JSON file in
  # the common "tavern" formats, or a YAML file in the Oobabooga format. With a single
  # string, the persona will be set to that string. Otherwise, the ai_name and persona will
  # be overwritten with the values in the file. Also, the wakewords will be extended to
  # include the character's own name.
  persona_file:

  # One or more words that the bot will listen for. The bot will listen in all discord
  # channels it can access for one of these words to be mentioned, then reply to any
  # messages it sees with a matching word. The bot will always reply to @-mentions and
  # direct messages, even if no wakewords are supplied.

discord:

  # Token to log into Discord with. For security purposes it's strongly recommended that you
  # set this via the DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable instead, if possible.
  discord_token: your_token_here

  # Set the log level. Valid values are: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
  #   default: DEBUG
  log_level:

  # The maximum number of chat history messages the AI will see when generating a response.
  # The actual number may be smaller than this, due to the model's context length limit.
  #   default: 7
  history_lines: 80

  # This is a list of allowed @-mention types. Used to limit what the bot can mention, e.g.
  # to prevent users from tricking the bot into @-mentioning large groups of people and
  # annoying them.
  # There are 3 possible types:
  # - `everyone`: the @everyone role
  # - `users`: enables @-mentioning users directly
  # - `roles`: enables @-mentioning roles
  # By default, none of these options are enabled and only the original author may be
  # @-mentioned.
  allowed_mentions:

  # If set, the bot will generate a thread to respond in if it is not already in one.
  #   default: False
  reply_in_thread:

  # Time in seconds (rounded to the nearest single decimal, i.e. in increments of 0.1) that
  # the bot will wait for additional messages before deciding to respond. Useful if people
  # post messages shortly after each other, or for use with bots like PluralKit or Tupperbox
  # that proxy your messages as another username and delete the original message.
  #   default: 0.0
  message_accumulation_period:

  # If this number of messages is added to the message queue while the bot is accumulating
  # messages according to the period above, the bot will stop waiting and immediately begin
  # processing the message queue. A value of 0 means this feature is disabled.
  #   default: 0
  continue_on_additional_messages:

  # Whether to squash all messages received during the message accumulation period together
  # and respond only once at the end. If set, the bot will respond to the latest message
  # received, otherwise it will respond to each message individually in the order they were
  # received.
  #   default: False
  respond_to_latest_only: true

  # If the bot receives a new message while in the middle of processing responses, cancel
  # the current message queue and start a new response to the latest message instead. This
  # takes effect regardless of whether the message accumulation period or
  # respond_to_latest_only is set. Image generation requests will not be cancelled.
  #   default: False
  skip_in_progress_responses: true

  # When the /unpoke command it used, this controls the amount of time the bot will refuse
  # to respond to any incoming messages or requests, unless poked.
  #   default: 15.0
  panic_duration:

  # Stream responses into a single message as they are generated. If not set, the feature is
  # disabled. Note: may be janky.
  # There are 2 options:
  # token: Stream responses by groups of tokens, whose size is defined by the stremaing
  # speed limit.
  # sentence: Stream responses sentence by sentence. Useful if streaming by token is too
  # janky but not splitting responses is too slow. Note: this will cause newlines to be
  # lost, as the responses are returned from the client without newlines.
  stream_responses:

  # When streaming responses, cap the rate at which we send updates to Discord to be no more
  # than once per this many seconds. This does not guarantee that updates will be sent this
  # fast, only that they will not be sent any faster than this rate. This is useful because
  # Discord has a rate limit on how often you can send messages, and if you exceed it, the
  # updates will suddenly become slow. Example: 0.2 means we will send updates no faster
  # than 5 times per second.
  #   default: 0.7
  stream_responses_speed_limit:

  # Post the entire response as a single message, rather than splitting it into separate
  # messages by sentence.
  #   default: False
  dont_split_responses:

  # If set, the bot will not respond to direct messages.
  #   default: False
  ignore_dms:

  # If set, the bot will not respond to other bots' messages. Be careful when disabling
  # this, as your bot may get into infinite loops with other bots.
  #   default: True
  ignore_bots:

  # This is a list of strings that the bot will ignore if messages begin with any of them.
  # These messages will be hidden from the chat history.
  ignore_prefixes:

  # Adds a limit to the number of channels per guild the bot will post unsolicited responses

  # When set, only the most recent N channels the bot has been summoned in will have a
  # chance of receiving an unsolicited response. The bot will still respond to @-mentions
  # and wake words in any channel it can access. Set to 0 to disable this feature.

  #   default: True
  use_immersion_breaking_filter:

  # A list of strings that will be used to filter out immersion-breaking messages when

  # should be removed as well.

  # Prevent impersonation by automatically adding the display names of the members in the

  # There are 3 options:
  # standard: Uses the fully templated user prompt prefix from the user history block.
  # aggressive: Uses just the "canonical" user display name (for models that use "narrative
  # voice"). This is the "common sense" transformation of any given name, i.e. using only
  # the first name in capitalized form, removing any emojis, etc.
  # comprehensive: Combines both standard and aggressive modes. Keep in mind the sequence
